Virus - Once you have reached the lowest level of the NET Architecture you can leave your own Virus in the Architecture to perform up to 2 actions or changes, within reason. Using this ability is the only way a Netrunner can make a change to a NET Architecture that persists after they Jack Out. Describe to the GM what you want the virus to do, and they will assign a DV. A more powerful Virus will require a higher DV to leave in the Architecture, as determined by the GM. Depending what you want to do, this can require as many NET Actions as the GM determines. Roll a Virus Check. The DV to destroy a Virus is equal to the Virus Check made to create it.
