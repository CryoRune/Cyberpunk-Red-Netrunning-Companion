## Cyberpunk RED Netrunning Companion
This is a passion project started after playing as a Netrunner in Cyberpunk RED and finding that it could be cumbersome running through NET Architectures for both myself and the gm. My plan is to make it simpler and more engaging to run so that everyone at the table can have more fun with a Netrunner in the party. I am not affiliated with Talsorian Games nor do I plan on attempting to make money with this project.

### Current Features:
The program allows the user to select their Netrunner level then navigate throughout a default NET Architecture using any Interface Ability. Black ICE will follow the Netrunner between floors unless Slide is used, with Slide only able to be used once a round. Passwords can be defeated with a successful Backdoor check, automatically succeeding if the password is already known. Files can be defeated with a successful Eye-Dee check. Once per netrun the user can Cloak and use Pathfinder, with the latter revealing floors equal to the check or until the first DV greater than the check. Zap will deal damage to the Black ICE the Netrunner targets if their Interface check beats a Defense check, causing the Black ICE to Derez once their REZ reaches 0.

Currently Slide only works if there is a single Black ICE on the floor. When a roll for a check is completed there is no visual indicator, as well as no feedback for failed checks. Control and Virus do nothing other than subtract a NET Action, as their primary actions rely on the GM.

### Planned Changes:
- Black ICE combat
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Specific features for Black ICE
- Choosing programs before entering NET
- Saving/Loading list of programs
- Randomly generating NET Architectures
- Loading custom NET Architectures
- Change Slide to have selection between multiple Black ICE

### Polishing:
- Change the Password Known/Unknown button to only show when there is a password
- Change the Interface and Zap target selection menus
- Give Control and Virus specific actions
